                    <h2>Googol: Web Page Search Engine</h2>
                    <p>The project aims to create a web page search engine with functionalities similar to services like
                        Google.com, Bing.com, and DuckDuckGo.com. The system includes automatic indexing (Web crawler)
                        and search capabilities. It should store relevant information about the pages, such as URL,
                        title, text citations, and more. Users can suggest URLs for indexing, and the system will
                        recursively index all links found on each page.</p>

                    <p>In this project, a web application was developed using the WebFlux framework, which is part of Spring Boot. The focus was on creating reactive applications, both on the server and client sides. The server exposed web services that allowed CRUD operations on data entities like Pet and Owner. The client application consumed these services and performed a series of queries to process and analyze the data in a non-blocking, reactive manner.</p>

                    <h2> Kafka Streams-Based E-Commerce Analytics</h2>
                    <p>This project involved creating a series of standalone applications to simulate an e-commerce environment, focusing on real-time data processing using Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams. The system was designed to handle streams of data related to sales and purchases of products (socks, in this case). The goal was to compute various metrics such as revenue, expenses, and profit, and then store the results back in a database.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apache Kafka: As the messaging system to handle streams of data.</li>

                    <p>This project involved configuring a secure VPN tunnel in a "road warrior" scenario, where remote
                        clients access services on an internal network through a VPN gateway. The assignment focused on
                        setting up mutual authentication using X.509 certificates, alongside two-factor authentication
                        (2FA) for both VPN and web server (Apache) access. The task also included managing a Public Key
                        Infrastructure (PKI) for certificate issuance and revocation.</p>
